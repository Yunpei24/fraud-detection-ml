# Azure Event Hub Support (Optional)
# This file includes azure-eventhub which requires cmake compilation
# Only use if you need Azure Event Hub functionality and have cmake installed

# First, install base requirements:
# pip install -r requirements.txt

# Then add Azure Event Hub support:
# pip install -r requirements-azure.txt

# For macOS with cmake issues, try:
# brew install cmake  # If cmake not installed
# export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib"
# export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include"
# pip install --no-binary uamqp uamqp==1.6.6  # Use pre-built wheels
# pip install azure-eventhub==5.10.0

# If compilation still fails, use the mock implementation instead:
# See: src/ingestion/event_hub.py for mock implementation

# Azure Event Hub with dependencies
azure-eventhub==5.10.0

# The uamqp package is a dependency that may require special handling:
# - On macOS: May need cmake and OpenSSL
# - On Linux: Usually works without issues
# - On Windows: Use pre-built wheels

# If installation fails with uamqp, alternatives:
# 1. Use Python 3.10 (has pre-built wheels)
# 2. Install cmake: brew install cmake
# 3. Use mock Event Hub for development
# 4. Use Kafka instead (works out of the box)
